Architecture:
1. Number system
Due to the limitation of integer values being represented in the 32bit or 64bit environment, using a array to represent the number is a much better solution that offers a lot more flexibility. Currently there is no memory shield installed in this demo, ideally if we were to tackle the issue we would need to make sure to remove results out of the memory as needed

2. Dynamic programming
We donâ€™t want to calculate the same result over and over again, so I save the calculated results in a sequential array to improve run time. everything is calculated in O(1)

3. Long operation #1 - calculation
The calculation of the number takes a long time, a calculation operation is created to take values from the UI thread and process it in the background, then spits it back to the UI thread. data synchronization is done through UI thread

4. Long operation #2 - display
Since the number can be really long, calculating the string is also done in the background through operations. Each cell owns a queue to take in the latest operation request
